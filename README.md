## MY JOURNEY TOWARDS DOCUMENTING THINGS IN MY JAVASCRIPT RELEARNING

- ## variables
  - const
  - let
  - var
    - ### differences between all three
      - const cannot be re-initialized.
      - const and var are block scope.
      - let and var can be re-initialized.
      - var is function scope
  - A block is a set of opening and closing braces
  - Scope determines the visibility of a variable in the area of your code
    - we have two types of scope
      - global scope
      - local scope
        - we have two types of local scopes:
          - function scope
          - block scope
  - ## Data types
    - primitive data type
      - number
      - strings
      - boolean
      - null - no value at all
      - undefined - a variable that has been declared but not initialized
      - symbol - identifier for object property
    - non-primitive data type
      - object
      - regex
      - array
    - operators
      - basic operators
        - -
        - -
        - -
        - /
        - ()
        - %
        - ++
        ***
      - comparison operators
        - ==
        - ===
        - !=
        - !==
        - `>`
        - <
        - `>=`
        - <=
      - logical operators
        - &&
        - ||
        - !
      - bitwise operators
        - ^
        - |
        - &
        - `>>`
        - <<
        - `>>>`
        - ~
    - Turthy / Falsy values
      - falsy values
        - 0
        - false
        - "", '', ``
        - null
        - undefined
        - NaN
        - `[]` - This is not falsy
      - Everything that is not falsy is truthy
